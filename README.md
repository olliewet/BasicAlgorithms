# BasicAlgorithms

Introduction 
- 
The Application has been created in C# using Visual Studio, the purpose of the application is to help imrpove my skills by implementing different alogirthms, while explaining how 
i have created the alogirthms and what they are used for. This readme file will include what algorithms have already been implemented and what algoirthms are going to be implemented
in the future of the application. 

Algorithms currently in the Project
